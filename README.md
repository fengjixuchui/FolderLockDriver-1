# FolderLockDriver
Folder Lock driver for Windows - helps you to hide and lock any files, folders. It can be used as a rootkit or as a protection system (everything depends on you).
This driver can help you to dive in to file system internals. I've wrote this driver after I've finished Rajeev Nagar's book - "Windows file system internals".
